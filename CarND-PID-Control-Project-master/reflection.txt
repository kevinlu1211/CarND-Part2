Meaning of each parameter:
P: is the amount to steer in proportion to the x-track error, the larger the error, 
   the faster the turn rate, this is calculated via -P * CTE for the turn rate
I: is the bias adjustment, turn value is calculated via I * (sum of CTE over time)
D: is the some constant which is the amount of counter-steer to apply, 
   turn value is calculated via D * (CTE_t - CTE_{t-1})


Process of choosing the final parameters:

I tested the parameters by using the simulator to make the car drive around the track. It took a while to get the intuition as to what the values the hyper-parameters were supposed to be at since a lot of them are confounding. In the end, the main thing that I realized was that the "I" needed to be a really low factor because as time goes on the error will add up especially if the car is swerving a lot

P = 1
I = 1
D = 1

The car was swerving too much so I lowered the P rate to 0.1. This is because the higher the P level, the more aggressively it will turn towards the center.

P = 0.1
I = 1
D = 1

Car was counter steering too little and as result it still get swerving off the road so I increase D to 4

P = 0.1
I = 1
D = 4

Car is fine at the start but starts to swerve more and more after some debugging it seems that the I is contributing too much to the steering so I lower it to 0.01. This makes sense as the longer the time, the more error it will accumulate

P = 0.1
I = 0.01
D = 4

The I factor is still contributing too much to the steering and a result it is making the car swerve off the road, so I half the I factor again

P = 0.1
I = 0.005
D = 4

Car swerves but it is a bit better than before as I believe I have fixed the I factor, though sometimes the car still swerves wildly. I tired lowering the I factor more though it didnâ€™t really seem to help. So it seems like more counter would make the car stay on the track so change D to 10

P = 0.1
I = 0.005
D = 10

It works!
